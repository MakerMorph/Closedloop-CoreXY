# Closedloop-CoreXY
CoreXY 3D Printer Build — A high school project documenting the design, build, and firmware development of a custom CoreXY 3D printer. Features a 340×340×400 mm frame, mixed motor setup including closed-loop Z-axis, and parts sourced/modified from the Voxelab Aquila C2.
CoreXY 3D Printer Build
Welcome to my CoreXY 3D printer project! This repository tracks all the steps, files, and details behind building a custom CoreXY printer with a 340×340×400 mm frame made from 2020 and 2040 aluminum extrusions. The printer features a triple Z-axis system with a mix of standard and pancake NEMA 17 motors, including a closed-loop setup on the main Z motor for improved accuracy.

Here, you'll find CAD models, firmware configurations, electronics wiring diagrams, and progress photos as I develop and refine the printer. This is part of my high school journey exploring 3D printing, mechanical design, and embedded systems.

Feel free to follow along or reach out if you want to collaborate or learn more!
